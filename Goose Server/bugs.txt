-- Known bugs.

- GID Event / ItemInfoEvent messed up.
Can't right click vendor items.

- Connection stays alive after closing for IP.

- Damage done doesn't display above enemies head.
(Probably because I treat damage as long now? Damage is / 100? Shouldn't I see -0 anyway for damage less than 100?

- Aether numbers displayed wrong
A NumberFormat should be enough.
